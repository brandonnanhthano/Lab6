## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and live preview the html file. I noticed that some of the functionality does not work in live preview so you might have to copy the link and paste it into the browser to get full functionality

## Usage

I added in tab functionality but its a little weird you will have to either tab to the options section and then you can use the arrow keys to move up or down the list of options and when you get to your option you can press tab again to take you to the button submit selection and then hit enter to submit it.





## accessibility

I added screen reader functionality and tab functionality to make the website easier for some users. Also if you have a web browser that doesn't support some of the newer programs there is a more basic version that you will see.
